<h2>NOTES</h2>
<h3>THE AUTHOR OF THE "CHARACTERISTICS."</h3>
<p>Lord Shaftesbury's <i>Letters to a young Man at the
University</i>, on which Mr. SINGER has addressed to you an
interesting communication (Vol. ii., p. 33.), were reprinted in
1746 in a collection of his letters, "<i>Letters of the Earl of
Shaftesbury, author of the Characteristicks, collected into one
volume</i>: printed MDCCXLVI." 18mo. This volume contains also Lord
Shaftesbury's letters to Lord Molesworth, originally published by
Toland, with an introduction which is not reprinted; a "Letter sent
from Italy, with the notion of the Judgment of Hercules, &amp;c.,
to my Lord &mdash;&mdash;"; and three letters reprinted from Lord
Shaftesbury's life in the <i>General Dicionary</i>, which was
prepared by Dr. Kippis, under the superintendence of Lord
Shaftesbury's son, the fourth earl.</p>
<p>In my copy of the original edition of the <i>Letters to a young
Man at the University</i>, two letters have been transcribed by an
unknown previous possessor. One is to Bishop Burnet, recommending
young Ainsworth when about to be ordained deacon:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To the Bishop of Sarum.</p>
<p>"Reigate, May 23. 1710.</p>
<p>"My Lord,&mdash;The young man who delivers this to your
Lordship, is one who for several years has been preparing himself
for the ministry, and in order to it has, I think, completed his
time at the university. The occasion of his applying this way was
purely from his own inclination. I took him a child from his poor
parents, out of a numerous and necessitous family, into my own,
employing him in nothing servile; and finding his ingenuity, put
him abroad to the best schools to qualify him for preferment in a
peculiar way. But the serious temper of the lad disposing him, as I
found, to the ministry preferably to other advantages, I could not
be his hindrance; though till very lately I gave him no prospect of
any encouragement through my interest. But having been at last
convinced, by his sober and religious courage, his studious
inclination and meek behaviour, that 'twas real principle and not a
vanity or conceit that led him into these thoughts, I am resolved,
in case your lordship thinks him worthy of the ministry, to procure
him a benefice as soon as anything happens in my power, and in the
mean time design to keep him as my chaplain in my family.</p>
<p>"I am, my Lord, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>"SHAFTESBURY."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second letter inserted in my copy is to Ainsworth himself,
dated Reigate, 11th May, 1711, and written when he was about to
apply for priest's orders. But the bulk of this letter is printed,
with a different beginning and ending, in the tenth printed letter,
under date July 10th, 1710, and is there made to apply to
Ainsworth's having just received deacon's orders. The beginning,
and ending of the letter, as in MS., are&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am glad the time is come that you are to receive full orders,
and that you hope it from the hands of our <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>{98}</span> great,
worthy, and excellent Bishop, the Lord of Salisbury. This is one of
the circumstances" [then the letter proceeds exactly as in the
printed Letter X., and the MS. letter concludes:] "God send you all
true Christianity, with that temper, life, and manners which become
it.</p>
<p>"I am, your hearty friend,</p>
<p>"SHAFTESBURY."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I quote the printed beginning of Letter X., on account of the
eulogy on Bishop Burnet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I believed, indeed, it was your expecting me every day at
&mdash;&mdash; that prevented your writing since you received
orders from the good Bishop, my Lord of Salisbury; who, as he has
done more than any man living for the good and honour of the Church
of England and the Reformed Religion, so he now suffers more than
any man from the tongues and slander of those ungrateful Churchmen,
who may well call themselves by that single term of distinction,
having no claim to that of Christianity or Protestant, since they
have thrown off all the temper of the former and all concern or
interest with the latter. I hope whatever advice the great and good
Bishop gave you, will sink deeply into your mind."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Singer has extracted from the eighth printed letter one or
two sentences on Locke's denial of innate ideas. A discussion of
Locke's views on this subject, or of Lord Shaftesbury's contrary
doctrine of a "moral sense," is not suited to your columns; and I
only wish to say that I think Mr. Singer has not made it
sufficiently clear that Lord Shaftesbury's remarks apply only to
the speculative consequences, according to his own view, of a
denial of innate ideas; and that Lord Shaftesbury, in another
passage of the same Letters, renders the following tribute of
praise to the <i>Essay on the Human Understanding</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am not sorry that I lent you Mr. Locke's <i>Essay on the
Human Understanding</i>, which may as well qualify for business and
the world as for the sciences and a University. No one has done
more towards the recalling of philosophy from barbarity into use
and practice of the world, and into the company of the better and
politer sort, who might well be ashamed of it in its other dress.
No one has opened a better or clearer way to reasoning; and, above
all, I wonder to hear him censured so much by any Church of England
men, for advancing reason and bringing the use of it so much into
religion, when it is by this only that we fight against the
enthusiasts and repel the great enemies of our Church."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A life of the author of the <i>Characteristics</i> is hardly
less a desideratum than that of his grandfather, the Lord
Chancellor, and would make an interesting work, written in
connection with the politics as well as literature of the reigns of
William and Anne; for the third Lord Shaftesbury, though prevented
by ill-health from undertaking office or regularly attending
parliament, took always a lively interest in politics. An
interesting collection of the third earl's letters has been
published by Mr. Foster (<i>Letters of Locke, Algernon Sidney, and
the Earl of Shaftesbury</i>), and a few letters from him to Locke
are in Lord King's <i>Life of Locke</i>. I subjoin a "note" of a
few original letters of the third Lord Shaftesbury in the British
Museum; some of your readers who frequent the British Museum may
perhaps be induced to copy them for your columns.</p>
<p>Letters to Des Maizeaux (one interesting, offering him pecuniary
assistance) in <i>Ags. Cat.</i> MSS. 4288.</p>
<p>Letters to Charles Montagu, Earl of Halifax<a id="footnotetag1"
name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>, (one
introducing Toland). Add. MSS. 7121.</p>
<p>Letter to Toland (printed, I think, in one of the <i>Memoirs of
Toland</i>). <i>Ags. Cat.</i> 4295. 10.</p>
<p>Letter to T. Stringer in 1625. Ib. 4107. 115.</p>
<p>In Watt's <i>Bibliotheca Britannica</i>, neither the <i>Letters
to a young Man at the University</i>, published in 1716, nor the
collection of letters of 1746, are mentioned; and confusion is made
between the author of the <i>Characteristics</i> and his
grandfather the Chancellor. Several political tracts, published
during the latter part of Charles II.'s reign, which have been
ascribed to the first Earl of Shaftesbury, but of which, though
they were probably written under his supervision, it is extremely
doubtful that he was the actual author, are lumped together with
the <i>Characteristics</i> as the works of one and the same Earl of
Shaftesbury.</p>
<p>Some years ago a discovery was made in Holland of MSS. of Le
Clerc, and some notice of the MSS., and extracts from them, are to
be found in the following work:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"De Joanne Clerico et Philippo A. Limborch Dissertationes
Du&aelig;. Adhibitis Epistolis aliisque Scriptis ineditis scripsit
atque eruditorum virorum epistolis nunc primum editis auxit Abr.
Des Amorie Van Der Hoeven, &amp;c. Amstelodami: apud Fredericum
Muller, 1843."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two letters of Locke are among the MSS. Now it is mentioned by
Mr. Martyn, the biographer of the first Earl of Shaftesbury, in a
MS. letter in the British Museum, that some of this earl's papers
were sent by the family to Le Clerc, and were supposed not to have
been returned. I mention this, as I perceive you have readers and
correspondents in Holland, in the hope that I may possibly learn
whether any papers relating to the first Earl of Shaftesbury have
been found among the lately discovered Le Clerc MSS.; and it is not
unlikely that the same MSS. might contain letters of the third
earl, the author of the <i>Characteristics</i>, who was a friend
and correspondent of Le Clerc.</p>
<p class="author">W.D. CHRISTIE.</p>
<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote1" name=

<p>Two of these&mdash;one a letter asking the earl to stand
godfather to his son, and the other a short note, forwarding a book
(Qy. of Toland's)&mdash;are printed by Sir Henry Ellis in his
Camden volume, <i>Letters of Eminent Literary
Men</i>.&mdash;ED.</p>

<h3>CAXTON'S PRINTING-OFFICE.</h3>
<p>The particular spot where Caxton exercised his business, or the
place where his press was fixed, cannot now, perhaps, be exactly
ascertained. Dr. Dibdin, after a careful examination of existing
testimonies, thinks it most probable that he erected his press in
one of the chapels attached to the aisles of Westminster Abbey; and
as no remains of this interesting place can now be discovered,
there is a strong presumption that it was pulled down in making
alterations for the building of Henry VII.'s splendid chapel.</p>
<p>It has been frequently asserted that all Caxton's books were
printed in a part of Westminster Abbey; this must be mere
conjecture, because we find no statement of it from himself: he
first mentions the place of his printing in 1477, so that he must
have printed some time without informing us where.</p>
<p>With all possible respect for the opinions of Dr. Dibdin, and
the numerous writers on our early typography, I have very
considerable doubts as to whether Caxton really printed <i>within
the walls of the Abbey</i> at all. I am aware that he himself says,
in some of his colophons, "Emprinted in th' Abbey of Westmynstre,"
but query whether the <i>precincts</i> of the Abbey are not
intended? Stow, in his <i>Annals</i> (edit 1560, p. 686.),
says,&mdash;"William Caxton of London, mercer, brought it
(printing) into England about the year 1471, and first practised
the same in the <i>Abbie</i> of St. Peter at Westminster;" but in
his <i>Survey of London</i>, 1603 (edit. Thoms, p. 176.), the same
writer gives us a more full and particular account; it is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Near unto this house [<i>i.e.</i> Henry VII.'s alms-house],
westward, was an old chapel of St. Anne; over against the which,
the Lady Margaret, mother to King Henry VII., erected an alms-house
for poor women, which is now turned into lodgings for the singing
men of the college. The place wherein this chapel and alms-house
standeth was called the Elemosinary, or almonry, now corruptly the
ambry, for that the alms of the Abbey were there distributed to the
poor; and therein Islip, abbot of Westminster, erected the first
press of book-printing that ever was in England, about the year of
Christ 1471. William Caxton, citizen of London, mercer, brought it
into England, and was the first that practised it <i>in the said
abbey</i>; after which time the like was practised in the abbeys of
St. Augustine at Canterbury, St. Albans, and other
monasteries."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, in the curious hand-bill preserved in the Bodleian
Library, it will be remembered that Caxton invites his customers to
"come to Westmonester <i>into the Almonestrye</i>," where they may
purchase his books "good chepe."</p>
<p>From these extracts it is pretty clear that Caxton's
printing-office was in the Almonry, which was within the precincts
of the Abbey, and not in the Abbey itself. The "old chapel of St.
Anne" was doubtless the place where the first printing-office was
erected in England. Abbot Milling (not Islip, as stated by Stow)
was the generous friend and patron of Caxton and the art of
printing; and it was by permission of this learned monk that our
printer was allowed the use of the building in question.</p>
<p>The <i>old</i> chapel of St. Anne stood in the New-way, near the
back of the workhouse, at the bottom of the almonry leading to what
is now called Stratton Ground. It was pulled down, I believe, about
the middle of the seventeenth century. The <i>new</i> chapel of St.
Anne, erected in 1631, near the site of the old one, was destroyed
about fifty years since.</p>
<p>Mr. Cunningham, in his <i>Handbook for London</i> (vol. i. p.
17.), says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The first printing-press ever seen in England was set up in
this almonry under the patronage of <i>Esteney</i>, Abbot of
Westminster, by William Caxton, citizen and mercer (d. 1483)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Esteney succeeded Milling in the Abbacy of Westminster, but the
latter did not die before 1492. On p. 520. of his second volume,
Mr. Cunninghan gives the date of Caxton's death correctly,
<i>i.e.</i> 1491.</p>

<hr />
<h3>SANATORY LAWS IN OTHER DAYS.</h3>
<p>In that curious medley commonly designated, after Hearne,
<i>Arnold's Chronicle</i>, and which was probably first printed in
1502 or 1503, we find the following passages. I make "notes" of
them, from their peculiar interest at the moment when sanatory
bills, having the same objects, are occupying the public attention
so strongly; especially in respect to the Smithfield Nuisance and
the Clergy Discipline bill.</p>
<p>1. In a paper entitled "The articles dishired bi y'e comonse of
the cety of London, for reformacyo of thingis to the same, of the
Mayer, Aldirmen, and Comon Counsell, to be enacted," we have the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Also that in anoyding the corupte savours and lothsom innoyaunc
(caused by slaughter of best) w'tin the cyte, wherby moche people
is corupte and infecte, it may plese my Lord Mayr, Aldirmen, and
Comen Counsaile, to put in execucion a certaine acte of parlement,
by whiche it is ordeigned y't no such slaughter of best shuld be
vsed or had within this cite, and that suche penaltees be leuyed
vpo the contrary doers as in the said acte of parlement ben
expressed.</p>
<p>"Also in anoyding of lyke annoyauce. Plese it my Lord Mair,
Alderme, and Como Councell, to enact that noo manor pulter or any
other persone i this cytee kepe from hinsforth, within his hous,
swans, gies, or dowk, upon a peyn therfore to be
ordeigned."&mdash;pp. 83, 84, 3d. ed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that one item of "folk-faith" is that "farm-yard
odours are healthy." I have often <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page100" id="page100"></a>{100}</span> heard it affirmed at least;
and, indeed, has not the common councilman, whom the <i>Times</i>
has happily designated as the "defender of filth", totally and
publicly staked his reputation on the dogma in its most extravagant
shape, within the last few months? It is clear that nearly four
centuries ago, the citizens of London thought differently; even
though "the corupte savours and lothsom innoyaunc" were infinitely
less loathsome than in the present Smithfield and the City
slaughter-houses.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know to what act of parliament
Arnold's citizens refer, and whether it has ever been repealed. It
is curious to notice, too, that the danger from infuriated beasts
running wild through the streets is not amongst the evils of the
system represented. They go further, however, and forbid even the
<i>killing</i> within the city.</p>
<p>Moreover, it would really seem that the swan was not then a mere
ornamental bird, either alive or dead, but an ordinary article of
citizen-dinners, it being classed with "gies and dowks" in the
business of the poulterer. At the same time, no mention being made
of swine in any of these ordonnances or petitions, would at first
sight seem to show that the flesh of the hog was in abhorrence with
the Catholic citizen, as much perhaps as with the Jews themselves;
at any rate, that it was not a vendible article of food in those
days. When did it become so? This conclusion would, however, be
erroneous; for amongst "the articles of the good governa&ucirc;ce
of the cite of London" shortly following we have this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Also yf ony persone kepe or norrysh hoggis, oxen, kyen, or
mallardis within the ward, in noyoying of ther neyhbours."&mdash;p.
91.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The proper or appointed place for keeping hoggis was Hoggistone,
now Hoxton; as Houndsditch<a id="footnotetag2" name=

<p>Of course "Houndsditch" is here meant; but for what purpose were
the hounds kept? And, indeed, what kind of hounds were they, that
thus formed a part of the City establishment? Were they bloodhounds
for tracking criminals, or hounds kept for the special behoof and
pleasure of the "Lord Mair, Aldermen, and Comen Co&ucirc;sel?" The
Houndsditch of that time bore a strong resemblance to the Fleet
ditch of times scarcely exceeding the memory of many living
men.</p>
<p>I come now to the passages relating to the clergy.</p>

<p>Upon these I shall make no remark. They will make different
impressions on different readers; according to the extent of
prejudice or liberality existing in different minds. They show that
even during the most absolute period of ecclesiastical domination,
there was one spot in England where attempts to legislate for the
priesthood (though perhaps feeble enough) were made. The
legislative <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id=
"page101"></a>{101}</span> powers of the corporation were at that
time very ample; and the only condition by which they appear to
have been limited was, that they should not override an act of
parliament or a royal proclamation.</p>
<p>Is there any specific account of the "tonne in Cornhyll"
existing? Its purpose, in connection with the conduit, admits of no
doubt; the forsworn and dishonest priest had been punished with a
"good ducking," and this, no doubt, accompanied with a suitable
ceremonial for the special amusement of the "'prentices."<a id=

<p>Mr. Cunningham, speaking of Houndsditch, merely quotes the words
of Stow. It would appear that Stow's reason for the name is
entirely conjectural; and indeed the same reason would justify the
same name being applied to all the "ditches" in London in the year
1500, and indeed much later. This passage of Arnold throws a new
light upon the <i>name</i>, at least, of that rivulet; for stagnant
its waters could not be, from its inclination to the horizon. It,
however, raises another question respecting the mode of keeping and
feeding hounds in those days; and likewise, as suggested in the
text, the further question, as to the purpose for which these
hounds were thus kept as a part of the civic establishment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote3" name=

<p>This view will no doubt be contested on the authority of Stow,
who describes the tonne as a "prison for night-walkers," so called
from the form in which it was built. (Cunningham, p. 141., 2nd ed.)
Yet, as Mr. Cunningham elsewhere states (p. xxxix.), "the Tun upon
Corn-hill [was] converted into a conduit" in 1401, it would hardly
be called a "prison" a century later. The probability is, that the
especial building called the tonne never was a prison at all; but
that the prison, from standing near or adjoining the tonne, took
its name, the tonne prison, in conformity with universal usage. It
is equally probable that the tonne was originally built for the
purpose to which it was ultimately applied; and that some delay
arose in its use from the difficulty experienced in the hydraulic
part of the undertaking, which was only overcome in 1401. The
universality of the punishment of "ducking" amongst our ancestors
is at least a circumstance in favour of the view taken in the
text.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>
<p><i>Midsummer Fires.</i>&mdash;From your notice of Mr. Haslam's
account of the Beltein or Midsummer fires in Cornwall, I conclude
you will give a place to the following note. On St. John's eve last
past, I happened to pass the day at a house situate on an elevated
tract in the county of Kilkenny, Ireland; and I shall long remember
the beauty of the sight, when, as dusk closed in, fire after fire
shot up its clear flame, thickly studding the near plains and
distant hills. The evening was calm and still, and the mingled
shouts and yells of the representatives of the old fire-worshippers
came with a very singular effect on the ear. When a boy, I have
often <i>passed through</i> the fire myself on Midsummer eve, and
such is still the custom. The higher the flame, the more daring the
act is considered: hence there is a sort of emulation amongst the
unwitting perpetrators of this Pagan rite. In many places cattle
are driven through the fire; and this ceremony is firmly believed
to have a powerful effect in preserving them from various harms. I
need not say, that amongst the peasantry the fires are now lighted
in honour of St John.</p>

<h3>MINOR NOTES.</h3>
<p><i>Borrowed Thoughts.</i>&mdash;Mr. SINGER (Vol. i., p. 482.)

epigram beginning&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<p>I should like to add two Queries:&mdash;Who was the Chevallier
de Cailly (or d'Aceilly), the author of the French epigram
mentioned by Mr. Singer? And&mdash;when did he live?</p>
<p class="author">H.C. DE ST. CROIX</p>
<p><i>An Infant Prodigy in 1659.</i>&mdash;The following wonderful
story is thus related by Archbishop Bramhall (Carte's
<i>Letters</i>, ii. 208.: Dr. Bramhall to Dr. Earles, Utrecht,
Sept. 6-16, 1659):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A child was born in London about three months since, with a
double tongue, or divided tongue, which the third day after it was
born, cried 'a King, a King,' and bid them bring it to the King.
The mother of the child saieth it told her of all that happened in
England since, and much more which she dare not utter. This my lady
of Inchiguin writeth to her aunt, <i>Me brow van
Melliswarde</i><a id="footnotetag4" name=
"footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>, living in
this city, who shewed me the letter. My Lady writeth that she
herself was as incredulous as any person, until she both saw and
heard it speak herself very lately, as distinctly as she herself
could do, and so loud that all the room heard it. That which she
heard was this. A gentleman in the company took the child in his
arms and gave it money, and asked what it would do with it, to
which it answered aloud that it would give it to the King. If my
Lady were so foolish to be deceived, or had not been an eye and ear
witness herself, I might have disputed it; but giving credit to
her, I cannot esteem it less than a miracle. If God be pleased to
bestow a blessing upon us, he cannot want means."</p>

<p>It can hardly be doubted that the Archbishop's miracle was a
ventriloquist hoax.</p>

<p><i>Allusion in Peter Martyr.</i>&mdash;Mr. Prescott, in his
<i>History of the Conquest of Mexico</i> vol. i. p. 389. (ed. 8vo.
1843), quotes from Peter Martyr, <i>De Orbe Novo</i>, dec. 1. c.
l., the words, "Una illis fuit spes salutis, desperasse de salute,"
applied to the Spanish invaders of Mexico; and he remarks that "it
is said with the classic energy of Tacitus." The <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>{102}</span>
expression is classical, but is not derived from Tacitus. The
allusion is to the verse of Virgil:&mdash;</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>"of pigs that he has lost</p>

<p>Upon this I have to remark that an intelligent grazier assures
me that pigs are never subject to the evil here complained of, but
that lambs of a year old, otherwise called "hogs" or "hoggets," are
often infested by it. It would appear, therefore, that the poet,
misled by the ambiguous name, and himself knowing nothing of the
matter but by report, attributed to pigs that which happens to the
other kind of animal, viz. lambs a year old, which have not yet
been shorn.</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>
<h3>A QUERY AND REPLIES.</h3>
<p><i>Plaister or Paster&mdash;Christian Captives&mdash;Members for
Calais, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;In editing Tyndale's <i>Pathway</i>
(<i>Works</i>, vol. i. p. 22.), I allowed preceding editors to
induce me to print <i>pastor</i>, where the oldest authority had
<i>paster</i>. As the following part of the sentence speaks of
"suppling and suaging wounds," I am inclined to suspect that
"paster" might be an old way of spelling, "plaster." Can any of
your correspondents supply me with any instance in which "plaster"
or "plaister" is spelt "paster" by any old English writer?</p>
<p>In return for troubling you with this question, you may inform
Mr. Sansom, in answer to Query, Vol. ii., p. 41., that Hallam says,
"Not less than fifty gentlemen were sold for slaves at Barbadoes,
under Cromwell's government." (<i>Constit. Hist.</i>, ch. x. note
to p. 128., 4to. edit.) And though Walker exaggerated matters when
he spoke "a project to sell some of the most eminent masters of
colleges, &amp;c., to the Turks for slaves," Whitelock's
<i>Memorials</i> will inform him, under date of Sept. 21, 1648,
that the English Parliament directed one of its committees "to take
care for transporting the Scotch prisoners, in the first place to
supply the plantations, and to send the rest to Venice."</p>
<p>To another, O.P.Q. (Vol. ii., p. 9.), you may state that the
members for Calais in the time of Edw. VI., and in the first four
parliaments of Mary, may be seen in Willis' <i>Notitia
Parliamentaria</i>, where their names are placed next to the
members for the Cinque Ports. Willis states that the return for
Calais for the last parliament of Henry VIII is lost. Their names
indicate that they were English,&mdash;such as Fowler, Massingberd,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>As to umbrellas, there are Oriental scholars who can inform your
inquirers that the word "satrap" is traceable to words whose
purport is, the bearer of an umbrella.</p>
<p>Another of your latest Querists may find the epigrams on George
II.'s (not, as he imagines, Charles I.'s) different treatment of
the two English universities in Knox's <i>Elegent Extracts</i>. The
lines he has cited are both from the same epigram, and, I think,
from the first of the two. They were occasioned by George. II's
purchasing the library of Dr. Moore, Bishop of Ely, and giving it
to the university of Cambridge.</p>
<p>The admirer of another epigram has not given it exactly as I can
remember it in a little book of emblems more than fifty years
ago:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The New Temple.</i>&mdash;As your correspondent L.B.L. states
(Vol. ii., p. 75.) that he has transcribed a MS. survey of the
Hospitallers' lands in England, taken in 1338, he will do me a
great kindness if he will extract so much of it as contains a
description of the New Temple in London, of which they became
possessed just before that date. It will probably state whether it
was then in the occupation of themselves or others: and, even if it
does not throw any light on the tradition that the lawyers were
then established there, or explain the division into the Inner and
Middle Temple, it will at least give some idea of the boundaries,
and perhaps determine whether the site of Essex House, which, in an
ancient record is called the Outer Temple, was then comprehended
within them.</p>

<p>"<i>Junius Identified.</i>"&mdash;The name of "John Taylor" is
affixed to the Preface, and there can be little doubt, I presume,
that Mr. John Taylor was literally <i>the writer</i> of this work.
It has, however, already become a question of some interest, to
what extent he was assisted by Mr. Dubois. The late Mr. George
Woodfall always spoke of the pamphlet as the work of Dubois. Lord
Campbell, in his <i>Lives of the Chancellors</i>, published a
statement by Lady Francis in respect to Sir Philip's claim to the
authorship of <i>Junius' Letters</i>, and thus introduced
it&mdash;"I am indebted for it to the kindness of my old and
excellent friend, Mr. Edward Dubois, <i>the ingenious author of
'Junius Identified'</i>" Mr. Dubois was then, and Mr. Taylor is now
living, and both remained silent. Sir Fortunatus Dwarris, the
intimate friend of Dubois, states that he was "<i>a connection</i>
of Sir Philip Francis", and that the pamphlet is "said, I know not
with what truth, to have been prepared under the eye of Sir Philip
Francis, it may be, through the agency of Dubois." Dubois was
certainly connected with, though not, I believe, related to Sir
Philip; and at the time of the publication he was also connected
with Mr. Taylor. I hope, under these circumstances, that Mr. Taylor
will think it right to favour you with a statement of the facts,
that future "Note"-makers may not perplex future editors with
endless "Queries" on the subject.</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>
<h3>FRENCH POEM BY MALHERBE.</h3>
<p>The two stanzas your correspondent E.R.C.B. has cited (Vol. ii.,

the good old age of seventy-three), which is entitled
<i>Consolation &agrave; Monsieur Du Perrier sur la Mort de sa
Fille</i>. It has always been a great favorite of mine; for, like
Gray's Elegy and the celebrated <i>Coplas</i> of Jorge Manrique on
the death of his father, beside its philosophic moralising strain,
it has that pathetic character which makes its way at once to the

<p>Et Rose elle a v&eacute;cu ce que vivent les roses,</p>
<p class="i2">L'espace d'un matin."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The whole poem consists of twenty-one stanzas and should be read
as a whole; but there are several other striking passages. The
consolation the poet offers to his friend breathes the spirit of
Epictetus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"De moy, d&eacute;j&agrave; deux fois d'une pareille foudre</p>
<p class="i2">Je me suis vu perclus,</p>
<p>Et deux fois la raison m'a si bien fait resoudre,</p>
<p class="i2">Qu'il ne m'en souvient plus.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Non qu'il ne me soit grief que la terre poss&egrave;de</p>
<p class="i2">Ce qui me fut si cher;</p>
<p>Mais en un accident qui n'a point de rem&egrave;de,</p>
<p class="i2">II n'en faut point chercher."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then follow the two stanzas cited by your correspondent, and the
closing verse is:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"De murmurer contre-elle et perdre patience,</p>
<p class="i2">Il est mal-&agrave;-propos:</p>
<p>Vouloir ce que Dieu veut, est la seule science</p>
<p class="i2">Qui nous met en repos."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The stanza beginning "Le pauvre en sa cabane," is an admirable
imitation of the "Pallida mors &aelig;quo pulsat pede," &amp;c. of
Horace, which a countryman of the poet is said to have less happily
rendered "La p&acirc;le mort avec son pied de cheval," &amp;c.</p>
<p>Malherbe has been duly appreciated in France: his works, in one
edition, are accompanied by an elaborate comment by Menage and
Chevreau: Racan wrote his life, and Godeau, Bishop of Vence, a
panegyrical preface. He was a man of wit, and ready at an
impromptu; yet it is said, that in writing a consolotary poem to
the President de Verdun, on the death of his wife, he was so long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id=
"page105"></a>{105}</span> in bringing his verses to that degree of
perfection which satisfied his own fastidious taste, that the
president was happily remarried, and the consolation not at all
required.</p>
<p>Bishop Hurd, in a note on the <i>Epistle to Augustus</i>, p.
72., says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Malherbe was to the French pretty much what Horace had been to
Latin poetry. These great writers had, each of them, rescued the
lyric muse of their country out of the rude ungracious hands of
their old poets. And, as their talents of a <i>good ear</i>,
<i>elegant judgment</i>, and <i>correct expression</i>, were the
same, they presented her to the public in all the air and grace,
and yet <i>severity</i>, of beauty, of which her form was
susceptible."</p>

<h3>"DIES IR&AElig;, DIES ILLA."</h3>
<p>In reply to the first of Mr. SIMPSON's Queries (Vol. ii., p.
72.) relative to the magnificent sequence <i>Dies ir&aelig;</i>, I
beg to say that the author of it is utterly unknown. The following
references may be sufficient:&mdash;Card. Bona, <i>Rer.
Liturgic.</i> lib. ii. cap. vi. p. 336., Rom&aelig;, 1671; or, if
possible, Sala's edition, tom. iii. p 143., Aug. Turin. 1753;
Gavantus, tom. i. pp. 274-5., Lugd. 1664; and the <i>Additions</i>
by Merati, i. 117-18., Aug. Vindel, 1740; Zaccaria, <i>Biblioth.
Ritual.</i> tom. i. p. 34., Rom&aelig;, 1776; Oldoini Addit. ad
Ciaconii <i>Vit. Pontiff. et Cardd.</i>, tom. ii. col. 222.,
Rom&aelig;, 1677.</p>
<p>Mr. SIMPSON's second question is, "In what book was it first
printed?" Joannes de Palentia, in his notes upon the <i>Ordinarium
PP. Pr&aelig;d.</i>, asserts that this celebrated prose was first
introduced into the Venice editions of the Missals printed for the
Dominicans. The oldest <i>Missale Pr&aelig;dicatorum</i> which I
possess, or have an opportunity of seeing, is a copy of the
Parisian impression of the year 1519; and herein the <i>Dies
ir&aelig;</i> is inserted in the <i>Commemoratio Defunctorum</i>;
mens. Novemb. sig. M. 5.</p>
<p>An inquiry remains as to the date of the general adoption of
this sequence by the Roman Church. In Quetif and Echard
(<i>Scriptt. Ord. Pr&aelig;d.</i> i. 437.), under the name of
Latinus Malabranca, we read that it certainly was not in use in the
year 1255; and there does not appear to be the slightest evidence
of its admission, even upon private authority, into the office for
the dead anterior to the commencement of the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>Your correspondent was not mistaken in his belief that he had
met with an imperfect transcript of this prose, for the original
consists not of "twenty-seven," but of <i>fifty-seven</i> lines. I
may add that I do not remember to have found the text more
correctly given than in the beautiful folio missal of the church of
Augsburg, partly printed on vellum in 1555 (fol. 466. b.).</p>
<p class="author">R.G.</p>
<p>The <i>Dies Ir&aelig;</i> is truly said by Mr. SPARROW SIMPSON
(Vol. ii., p. 72.) to be an extremely beautiful hymn. Who was its
author is very doubtful, but the probabilities are in favour of
Thomas de Celano, a Minorite friar, who lived during the second
half of the fourteenth century. It consists of nineteen strophes,
each having three lines. Bartholomew of Pisa, A.D. 1401, in his
<i>Liber Conformitatum</i>, speaks of it; but the earliest printed
book in which I have ever seen this hymn, is the <i>Missale
Romanum</i>, printed at Pavia, A.D. 1491, in 8vo., a copy of which
I have in my possession.</p>

<h3>DR. SAMUEL OGDEN.</h3>
<p>In reply to your correspondent TWYFORD (Vol. ii., p. 73.), the
original of the common surname <i>Ogden</i> is doubtless Oakden. A
place so called is situated in Butterworth, Lancashire, and gave
name to a family,&mdash;possibly extinct in the sixteenth century.
A clergymam, whose name partook both of the original and its
corruption, was vicar of Bradford, 1556, viz Dus Tho. <i>Okden</i>.
The arms and crest borne by the Oakdens were both allusive to the
name, certainly without any reference to King Charles's
hiding-place.</p>
<p>Dr. Samuel Ogden, born in 1716 at Winchester, was the son of
Thomas Ogden, a man of very humble origin: but he had the merit of
giving a liberal education to one whose natural talents well
deserved culture; and both his parents, in the decline of life,
owed their support to Ogden's filial piety and affection. Cole is
quite mistaken in fixing the father's residence at Mansfield, and
in stating that he had been in the army. The monument, spoken of by
Cole, is not at Mansfield, but in the cathedral of Manchester: nor
is it a memorial of Dr. Ogden. It was placed by him in memory of
his <i>father</i>. Ogden was buried in his own church, St.
Sephlchre's, Cambridge.</p>
<p>The following epigram, it is believed, has not been printed. It
is transcribed from a letter in my possession, addressed by the
first Lord Alvanley, when at college, to his former tutor, Mr.
Thyer, editor of <i>Butler's Remains</i>:&mdash;</p>

<h3>Replies to Minor Queries.</h3>
<p><i>Porson's Imposition</i> (Vol. i., p. 71.) is indeed, I
believe, an <i>imposition</i>. The last line quoted (and I suppose
all the rest) can hardly be Porson's, for Mr. Langton amused
Johnson, Boswell, and a dinner party at General Oglethorpe's, on
the 14th of April, 1778, with some macaronic Greek "by <i>Joshua
Barnes</i>, in which are to be found such comical Anglo-hellenisms
as [Greek: klubboisin ebagchthae] they were banged with clubs."

<p><i>The Three Dukes</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 9, 46, 91.).&mdash;Andrew
Marvel thus makes mention of the outrage on the beadle in his
letter to the Mayor of Hull, Feb. 28, 1671 (<i>Works</i>, i.
195.):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On Saturday night last, or rather Sunday morning, at two
o'clock, some persons reported to be of great quality, together
with other gentlemen, set upon the watch and killed a poor beadle,
praying for his life upon his knees, with many wounds; warrants are
out for apprehending some of them, but they are fled."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not aware of any contemporary authority for the names of
the three dukes; and a difficulty in the way of assigning them by
conjecture is, that in the poem they are called "three bastard
dukes." Your correspondent C. has rightly said (p. 46.) that none
of Charles II.'s bastard sons besides Monmouth would have been old
enough in 1671 to be actors in such a fray. Sir Walter Scott, in
his notes on <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, referring to the poem,
gives the assault to Monmouth and some of his brothers; but he did
so, probably, without considering dates, and on the strength of the
words "three bastard dukes."</p>
<p>Mr. Lister, in the passage in his <i>Life of Clarendon</i>
referred to by Mr. Cooper (p. 91.), gives no authority for his
mention of Albemarle. I should like to know if Mr. Wade has any
other authority than Mr. Lister for this statement in his useful
compilation.</p>
<p>Were it certain that three dukes were engaged in this fray, and
were we not restricted to "bastards," I should say that Monmouth,
Albemarle, and Richmond (who married the beautiful Miss Stuart, and
killed himself by drinking) would probably be the three culprits.
As regards Albemarle, he might perhaps have been called bastard
without immoderate use of libeller's licence.</p>
<p>If three dukes did murder the beadle, it is strange that their
names have not been gibbeted in many of the diaries and letters
which we have of that period. And this is the more strange, as this
assault took place just after the attack on Sir John Coventry,
which Monmouth instigated, and which had created so much
excitement.</p>
<p>The question is not in itself of much importance; but I can
suggest a mode in which it may possibly be settled. Let the royal
pardons of 1671 be searched in the Rolls' Chapel, Chancery Lane. If
the malefactors were pardoned by name, the three dukes may there
turn up. Or if any of your readers is able to look through the
Domestic Papers for February and March, 1671, in the State Paper
Office, he would be likely to find there come information upon the
subject.</p>
<p>Query. Is the doggerel poem in the <i>State Poems</i> Marvel's?
Several poems which are ascribed to him are as bad in
versification, and, I need not say, in coarseness.</p>
<p>Query 2. Is there any other authority for Queen Catharine's
fondness for dancing than the following lines of the poem?</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"See what mishaps dare e'en invade Whitehall,</p>
<p>This silly fellow's death puts off the ball,</p>

<p><i>Kant's S&auml;mmtliche Werke.</i>&mdash;Under the head of
"Books and Odd Volumes" (Vol. ii., p. 59.), there is a Query
respecting the XIth part of Kant's <i>S&auml;mmtliche Werke</i>, to
which I beg to reply that it was published at Leipzig, in two
portions, in 1842. It consists of Kant's Letters, Posthumous
Fragments, and Biography. The work was completed by a 12th vol.,
containing a history of the Kantian Philosophy, by Carl Rosenkranz,

<p><i>Becket's Mother</i> (Vol. i., pp. 415. 490.; vol. ii., p.
78.).&mdash;Although the absence of any contemporaneous relation of
this lady's romantic history may raise a reasonable doubt of its
authenticity, it seems to derive indirect confirmation from the
fact, that the hospital founded by Becket's sister shortly after
his death, on the spot where he was born, part of which is now the
Mercers' chapel in Cheapside, was called "The Hospital of St.
Thomas the Martyr <i>of Acon</i>." Erasmus, also, in his
<i>Pilgrimages to Walsingham and Canterbury</i> (see J.G. Nichol's
excellent translation and notes, pp. 47. 120.), says that the
archbishop was called "Thomas <i>Acrensis</i>."</p>
<p class="author">Edward Foss.</p>
<p><i>"Imprest" and "Debenture."</i>&mdash;Perhaps the following
may be of some use to D.V.S. (Vol. ii., p. 40.) in his search for
the verbal raw material out of which these words were
manufactured.</p>
<p>Their origin may, I think, be found in the Latin terms used in
the ancient accounts of persons <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page107" id="page107"></a>{107}</span> officially employed by the
crown to express transactions somewhat similar to those for which
they appear to be now used. Persons conversant with those records
must frequently have met with cases where money advanced, paid on
account, or as earnest, was described as "de prestito" or "in
prestitis." Ducange gives "pr&aelig;stare" and its derivatives as
meaning "mutuo dare" with but little variation; but I think that
too limited a sense. The practice of describing a document itself
by the use of the material or operative parts expressing or
defining the transaction for which it was employed, is very common.
In legal and documentary proceedings, it is indeed the only one
that is followed. Let D.V.S. run over and compare any of the
well-known descriptions of writs, as <i>habeas corpus</i>,
<i>mandamus</i>, <i>fi. fa.</i>: or look into Cowell's
<i>Interpreter</i>, or a law dictionary, and he will see numerous
cases where terms now known as the names of certain documents are
merely the operative parts of Latin <i>formul&aelig;</i>. "Imprest"
seems to be a slightly corrupted translation of "in prestito;" that
part of the instrument being thus made to give its name to the
whole. Of "debenture" I think there is little doubt that it may be
similarly explained. Those Record Offices which possess the ancient
accounts and vouchers of officers of the royal household contain
numerous "debentures" of the thirteenth, but far more of the
fourteenth, century. In this case the <i>initial</i> is the chief
operative word: those relating to the royal wardrobe, commencing
"Debentur in garderoba domini regis," being in fact merely
memorandums expressing or acknowledging that certain sums of money
"are owing" for articles supplied for the use of that department.
It is well known that the royal exchequer was, at the time these
documents were executed, often in great straits; and it seems to me
scarcely doubtful that these early "debentures" were actually
delivered over to tradesmen, &amp;c., as security for the amount
due to them, and given in to be cancelled when the debts were
discharged by the Exchequer officers.</p>
<p>There is a remarkable feature about these ancient "debentures"
which I may perhaps be permitted to notice here, viz., the very
beautiful seals of the officers of the royal household and wardrobe
which are impressed upon them. They are of the somewhat rare
description known as "appliqu&eacute;;" and at a time when personal
seals were at the highest state of artistic developement, those few
seals of the clerks of the household which have escaped injury (to
which they are particularly exposed) are unrivalled for their
clearness of outline, design, delicacy, and beauty of
execution.</p>
<p>Allowing for the changes produced by time, I think sufficient
analogy may be found between the ancient and modern uses of the
words "imprest" and "debenture."</p>
<p class="author">J. BT.</p>
<p>"<i>Imprest</i>" (Vol. ii., p. 40).&mdash;D.V.S. will find an
illustration of the early application of this word to advances made
by the Treasury in the "Rotulus de <i>Prestito</i>" of 12 John,
printed by the Record Commission under the careful editorship of
Mr. T. Duffus Hardy, whose preface contains a clear definition of
its object, and an account of other existing rolls of the same
character.</p>
<p class="author">EDWARD FOSS.</p>
<p><i>Derivation of News.</i>&mdash;P.C.S.S. has read with great
interest the various observations on the derivation of the word
"News" which have appeared in the "NOTES AND QUERIES," and
especially those of the learned and ingenious Mr. Hickson. He
ventures, however, with all respect, to differ from the opinion
expressed by that gentleman in Vol. i., p. 81., to the effect
that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In English, there is no process known by which a noun plural
can be formed from an adjective, without the previous formation of
the singular in the same sense."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>P.C.S.S. would take the liberty of reminding Mr. H. of the
following passage in the <i>Tempest</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">"When that is gone,</p>
<p>He shall drink nought but brine, for I'll not show him</p>
<p>Where the quick freshes lie."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Surely, in this instance, the plural noun "freshes" is not
formed from any such singular noun as "<i>fresh</i>," but directly
from the adjective, which latter does not seem to have been ever
used as a singular <i>noun</i>.</p>
<p>While on the subject of "News," P.C.S.S. finds in Pepys'
<i>Diary</i> (vol. iii. p. 59.) another application of the word, in
the sense of a noun singular, which he does not remember to have
seen noticed by others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Anon, the coach comes&mdash;in the meantime, there coming a
<i>news</i> thither, with his horse to come over."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other parts of the <i>Diary</i>, the word <i>News-book</i> is
occasionally employed to signify what is now termed a newspaper,
or, more properly, a bulletin. For instance (vol. iii. p. 29.), we
find that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This <i>News-book</i>, upon Mr. Moore's showing L'Estrange
Captain Ferrers's letter, did do my Lord Sandwich great right as to
the late victory."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again (at p. 51.):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I met this noon with Dr. Barnett, who told me, and I find in
the <i>News-book</i> this week, that he posted upon the 'Change,'"
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much has been lately written in the "NOTES AND QUERIES"
respecting the "Family of Love." A sect of a similar name existed
here in 1641, and a full and not very decent description of their
rites and orgies is to be found in a small pamphlet of that date,
reprinted in the fourth volume (8vo. ed.) of the <i>Harleian
Miscellany</i>.</p>

<p><i>Origin of Adur</i> (Vol. ii., p. 71.).&mdash;A, derived from
the same root as Aqua and the French <i>Eau</i>, is a frequent
component of the names of rivers: "A-dur, A-run, A-von, A-mon," the
adjunct being supposed to express the individual characteristic of
the stream. <i>A-dur</i> would then mean the <i>river of oaks</i>,
which its course from Horsham Forest through the Weald of Sussex,
of which "oak is the weed," would sufficiently justify. It is
called in ancient geography <i>Adurnus</i>, and is probably from
the same root as the French <i>Adour</i>.</p>
<p class="author">C.</p>
<p>The river Adur, which passes by Shoreham, is the same name as
the Adour, a great river in the Western Pyrenees.</p>
<p>This coincidence seems to show that it is neither a Basque word,
nor a Saxon. Whether it is a mere expansion of <i>ydwr</i>, the
water, in Welch, I cannot pretend to say, but probably it includes
it.</p>
<p>We have the Douro in Spain; and the Doire, or Doria, in
Piedmont. Pompadour is clearly derived from the above French river,
or some other of the same name.</p>
<p class="author">C.B.</p>
<p><i>Meaning of Steyne</i> (Vol. ii., P. 71.).&mdash;Steyne is no
doubt <i>stone</i>, and may have reference to the original name of
Brighthelm-<i>stone</i>: but what the <i>stone</i> or "steyne" was,
I do not conjecture; but it lay or stood probably on that little
flat valley now called the "Steyne." It is said that, so late as
the time of Elizabeth, the town was encompassed by a high and
strong <i>stone wall</i>; but that could have no influence on the
name, which, whether derived from Bishop <i>Brighthelm</i> or not,
is assuredly of Saxon times. There is a small town not far distant
called <i>Steyning, i.e.</i> the meadow of the stone. In my early
days, the name was invariably pronounced Brighthamstone.</p>
<p class="author">C.</p>
<p><i>Sarum and Barum</i> (Vol. ii., p. 21.).&mdash;As a
conjecture, I would suggest the derivation of <i>Sarum</i> may have
been this. Salisbury was as frequently written Sarisbury. The
contracted form of this was Sap., the ordinary import of which is
the termination of the Latin genitive plural <i>rum</i>. Thus an
imperfectly educated clerk would be apt to read <i>Sarum</i>
instead of Sarisburia; and the error would pass current, until one
reading was accepted for right as much as the other. In other
instances we adopt the Law Latin or Law French of medi&aelig;val
times; as the county of <i>Oxon</i> for Oxfordshire, <i>Salop</i>
for Shropshire, &amp;c., and <i>Durham</i> is generally supposed to
be French (<i>Duresmm</i>), substituted for the Anglo-Saxon
Dunholm, in Latin <i>Dunelmum</i>. I shall perhaps be adding a
circumstance of which few readers will be aware, in remarking that
the Bishops of Durham, down to the present day, take alternately
the Latin and French signatures, <i>Duresm</i> and
<i>Dunelm</i>.</p>

entertaine the least thought of the signification of
<i>Dulcarnon</i> to be <i>Pythagorus</i> his sacrifice after his
geometricall theorem in finding the square of an orthogonall
triangle's sides, or that it is a word of <i>Latine</i> deduction:

meaning <i>Alexander</i>, as that great dictator of knowledge,
<i>Joseph Scaliger</i> (with some ancients) wills, but, by
warranted opinion of my learned friend Mr. <i>Lydyat</i>, in his
<i>Emendatio Temporum</i>, it began in <i>Seleucus Nicanor</i>, XII
yeares after <i>Alexander's</i> death. The name was applyed, either
because after time that <i>Alexander</i> had persuaded himself to
be <i>Jupiter Hammon's</i> sonne, whose statue was with
<i>Ram's</i> hornes, both his owne and his successors' coins were
stampt with horned images: or else in respect of his II pillars
erected in the East as a <i>Nihil ultra</i><a id="footnotetag6"
name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> of
his conquest, and some say because hee had in power the Easterne
and Westerne World, signified in the two hornes. But howsoever, it
well fits the passage, either, as if hee had personated
<i>Creseide</i> at the entrance of two wayes, not knowing which to
take; in like sense as that of <i>Prodicus</i> his <i>Hercules</i>,
<i>Pythagoras</i> his <i>Y.</i>, or the Logicians <i>Dilemma</i>
expresse; or else, which is the truth of his conceit, that hee was
at a <i>nonplus</i>, as the interpretation in his next staffe makes
plaine. How many of noble <i>Chaucer's</i> readers never so much as
suspect this his short essay of knowledge, transcending the common
Rode? And by his treatise of the <i>Astrolabe</i> (which, I dare
sweare, was chiefly learned out of <i>Messahalah</i>) it is plaine
hee was much acquainted with the mathematiques, and amongst their
authors had it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>D'Herbelot</i> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Dhoul</i> (or <i>Dhu</i>) <i>carnun</i>, <i>with the two
horns</i>, is the surname of <i>Alexander</i>, that is, of an
ancient and fabulous Alexander of the first dynasty of the
Persians. 795. Article Sedd, Tagioug and Magioug. 993. Article
Khedher. 395. b. 335. b. Fael.</p>
<p>"But 317. Escander, he says, Alexander the Great has the same
title secondarily. The truth probably is the reverse, that the
fabulous personage was taken from the real conqueror.</p>
<p>"<i>Hofmann</i>, in Seleucus, says that the area of Seleucus is
called Terik Dhylkarnain, <i>i.e.</i> Epocha Alexandri Cornigen.
Tarik means probably the date of an event."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There can be no doubt that the word in Chaucer is this Arabic
word; nor, I think, that Speght's story is really taught by the
Arabs, our teachers in mathematics. Whether the application is from
Alexander, (they would know nothing of his date with regard to
Pythagoras), or merely from two-horned, is doubtful. The latter
might possibly mean the ox.</p>
<p>Mr. Halliwell gives a quotation from Stanyhurst, in which it
means "dull persons"&mdash;an obvious misuse of it for Englishmen,
and which Skene fortifies by an A.-S. derivation, but which is
clearly not Cressida's meaning, or she would have said, "I
<i>am</i> Dulcarnon," not "I <i>am at</i> Dulcarnon;" and so Mrs.
Roper.</p>
<p>It may seem difficult what Pandarus can mean:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Dulcarnon clepid is fleming of wretches,</p>
<p>It semith hard, for wretchis wol nought lere</p>
<p>For very slouthe, or othir wilfull tetches,</p>
<p>This said is by them that ben't worth two fetches,</p>
<p>But ye ben wise."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Whether he means that wretches call it <i>fleming</i> or not,
his argument is, "You are not a wretch." Speght's derivation seems
to mean, "Quod stultos vertit." <i>Fleamas</i>, A.-S. (Lye), is
<i>fuga</i>, <i>fugacio</i>, from <i>flean</i>, to flee. Pandarus,
I think, does not mean to give the derivation of the word, but its
application of fools, a stumbling-block, or puzzle.</p>

<p><i>America known to the Ancients.</i>&mdash;To the list of
authorities on this subject given in Vol. i., p. 342., I have the
pleasure to add Father Laffiteau; Bossu<a id="footnotetag7" name=
"footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>, in his
<i>Travels through Louisiana</i>; and though last, not least,
Acosta, who in his <i>Naturall and Morall Historie of the East and
West Indies</i>, translated by E.G. [Grimestone], 1604, 4to.,
devotes eighty-one pages to a review of the opinions of the
ancients on the new world.</p>
<p>The similarity which has been observed to exist between the
manners of several American nations, and those of some of the
oldest nations on our continent, which seems to demonstrate that
this country was not unknown in ancient times, has been traced by
Nicholls, in the first part of his <i>Conference with a Theist</i>,
in several particulars, viz. burning of the victim in sacrifices,
numbering by tens, fighting with bows and arrows, their arts of
spinning, weaving, &amp;c. The arguments, multitudinous as they
are, adduced by Adair for his hypothesis that the American Indians
are descended from the Jews, serve to prove that the known or old
world furnished the new one with men. To these may be added the
coincidences noticed in "NOTES AND QUERIES;" burning the dead (Vol.
i., p. 308.); the art of manufacturing glass (p. 341.); scalping
(Vol. ii., p. 78.). Your correspondents will doubtless be able to
point out other instances. Besides drinking out of the skulls of
their enemies, recorded of the Scythians by Herodotus; and of the
savages of Louisiana by Bossu; I beg to mention a remarkable one
furnished by Catlin&mdash;the sufferings endured by the youths
among the Mandans, when admitted into the rank of warriors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id=

<p class="author">[Greek: Phi.]</p>
<p><i>Martello Towers</i> (Vol. ii., p. 9.).&mdash;A misspelling
for <i>Mortella</i> towers. They are named after a tower which
commands the entrance to the harbour of St. Fiorenzo, in Corsica;
but they are common along the coasts of the Mediterranean. They
were built along the low parts of the Sussex and Kent coasts, in
consequence of the powerful defence made by Ensign Le Tellier at
the Tower of Mortella, with a garrison of 38 men only, on 8th
February, 1794, against an attack by sea, made by the
<i>Fortitude</i> and <i>Juno</i>, part of Lord Hood's fleet, and by
land, made by a detachment of troops under Major-General Dundas.
The two ships kept up a fire for two hours and a half without
making any material impression, and then hauled out of gun-shot,
the <i>Fortitude</i> having lost 6 men killed and 56 wounded, 8
dangerously. The troops were disembarked, and took possession of a
height comnanding the tower; and their battering was as
unsuccessful, till a hot shot fell and set fire to the bass-junk,
with which, to the depth of five feet, the immensely thick parapet
wall was lined. This induced the small garrison, of whom two were
mortally wounded, to surrender. The tower mounted only one 6 and
two 18-pounders, and the carriage of one of the latter had been
rendered unserviceable during the cannonade. (See James' <i>Naval
History</i>, vol. i. p. 285.) The towers along the English coast
extend from Hythe to Seaford, where the last tower is numbered 74,
at intervals of about a quarter of a mile, except where the coast
is protected by the cliffs. The tower at Seaford is 32 feet high,
with a circumference of 136 feet at the base, and gradually
tapering to 90 feet at the top. The wall is 6 feet thick at the top
next the sea, and 2 feet on the land side. The cost of each tower
was very large,&mdash;from 15,000<i>l.</i> to 20,000<i>l.</i> I am
not aware of any blue book on the subject; blue books were not so
much in vogue at the time of their erection, or perhaps a little
less would have been spent in these erections, and a little more
pains would have been taken to see that they were properly built.
Some have been undermined by the sea and washed down already; in
others, the facing of brick has crumbled away; and in all the
fancied security which the original tower taught us to expect would
be probably lessened were the English towers subjected to an
attack.</p>

tempore, nihil pro veritate." Is this <i>Discur. Compen.</i> the
<i>Discurs. Modest.</i>? and are these words to be found in
Watson's <i>Quodlibets</i>? This would fix the identity of the two
books. It is curious that the only two references made by Bishop
Andrews to the <i>Discurs. Modest.</i> (<i>Respons. ad Apol.</i>,
pp. 7. and 117.) are to page 13., and both the statements are found

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, &amp;C.</h3>
<p>Mr. Bohn has just published the second volume of his very useful
and complete edition of <i>Junius' Letters</i>. It contains, in
addition to a new essay on their authorship, entitled <i>The
History and Discovery of Junius</i>, by the editor, Mr. Wade, the
Private Letters of Junius addressed to Woodfall; the Letters of
Junius to Wilkes; and the Miscellaneous Letters which have been
attributed to the same powerful pen. Mr. Wade is satisfied that Sir
Philip Francis was Junius; a theory of which it is said, "Se non e
vero e ben trovato:" and, if he does not go the length of Sir F.
Dwarris in regarding Sir P. Francis, not as the solitary champion,
but the most active of the sturdy band of politicians whose views
he advocated, he shows that he was known to and assisted by many
influential members of his own political party. Some of the most
curious points in the Junius history are illustrated by notes by
Mr. Bohn himself, who, we have no doubt will find his edition of
Junius among the most successful volumes of his Standard
Library.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
